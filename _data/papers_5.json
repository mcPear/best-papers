Here we show that scaling up\nlanguage models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes\neven reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning\napproaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with\n175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,\nand test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is\napplied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot\ndemonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3\nachieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,\nquestion-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require\non-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a\nnovel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic.

Knowledge graph embedding is\norganized from four aspects of representation space, scoring function, encoding\nmodels, and auxiliary information. For knowledge acquisition, especially\nknowledge graph completion, embedding methods, path inference, and logical rule\nreasoning, are reviewed. We further explore several emerging topics, including\nmeta relational learning, commonsense reasoning, and temporal knowledge graphs.\nTo facilitate future research on knowledge graphs, we also provide a curated\ncollection of datasets and open-source libraries on different tasks.

Qwen is a comprehensive\nlanguage model series that encompasses distinct models with varying parameter\ncounts. It includes Qwen, the base pretrained language models, and Qwen-Chat,\nthe chat models finetuned with human alignment techniques. The base language\nmodels consistently demonstrate superior performance across a multitude of\ndownstream tasks, and the chat models, particularly those trained using\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are highly competitive. The\nchat models possess advanced tool-use and planning capabilities for creating\nagent applications, showcasing impressive performance even when compared to\nbigger models on complex tasks like utilizing a code interpreter. Furthermore,\nwe have developed coding-specialized models, Code-Qwen and Code-Qwen-Chat, as\nwell as mathematics-focused models, Math-Qwen-Chat, which are built upon base\nlanguage models.

A recently proposed method named Context Optimization (CoOp)\nintroduces the concept of prompt learning -- a recent trend in NLP -- to the\nvision domain for adapting pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically,\nCoOp turns context words in a prompt into a set of learnable vectors and, with\nonly a few labeled images for learning, can achieve huge improvements over\nintensively-tuned manual prompts. In our study we identify a critical problem\nof CoOp: the learned context is not generalizable to wider unseen classes\nwithin the same dataset, suggesting that CoOp overfits base classes observed\nduring training. To address the problem, we propose Conditional Context\nOptimization (CoCoOp), which extends CoOp by further learning a lightweight\nneural network to generate for each image an input-conditional token (vector).\nCompared to CoOp's static prompts, our dynamic prompts adapt to each instance\nand are thus less sensitive to class shift. Extensive experiments show that\nCoCoOp generalizes much better than CoOp to unseen classes, even showing\npromising transferability beyond a single dataset; and yields stronger domain\ngeneralization performance as well.

CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic\ncapabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as\nwell as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases\nquickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks,\nidentifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models.
