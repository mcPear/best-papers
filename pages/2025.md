<p class="featured_snippet">The top NLP papers of 2025 were a game-changer with the rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). DeepSeek-R1, s1, and many follow-up papers on test-time scaling and chain-of-thought optimization showed what’s possible with reinforcement learning driven reasoning. The year saw significant advances in multimodal reasoning with Qwen2.5-VL and Vision-R1, as well as substantial architectural innovations with Qwen3’s unified thinking/non-thinking framework and new, efficient attention mechanisms. These papers present models that can “think” more deeply and carefully, addressing computational challenges with efficiency-focused approaches such as CoT-Valve and TokenSkip. They pushed the limits of what’s possible in automated reasoning, multimodal understanding, and AI-assisted scientific discovery.</p>
