### Your opinion is very valuable to me

I'm eager to know whether this site is beneficial to you! Let me know your thoughts on it via email or Linkedin.

### Concerning citation counts

The website uses citation counts to determine "the best" scientific papers. However, citation counts have [significant drawbacks](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-drawbacks-of-citation-count), so interpret them wisely. The data presented here is suitable for **general educational purposes** but is unlikely to be useful for advanced academic research.

### Thank you to arXiv for use of its open access interoperability.
