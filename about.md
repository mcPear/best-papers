### Your opinion is very valuable to me

I would love to hear your feedback on whether this site has been **beneficial to you**! Please let me know your thoughts via email or Linkedin.

### Concerning citation counts

This website uses citation counts to determine "the best" scientific papers. However, citation counts have [significant drawbacks](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-drawbacks-of-citation-count), so interpret them wisely. The data presented here is suitable for **general educational purposes** but is unlikely to be useful for advanced academic research.

### Thank you to arXiv for use of its open access interoperability.
